I'm a software developer and graduate of The University of Alabama, class of 2025. I am interested in Backend Development, Autonomous Robotics, and Cloud Computing. I'm a big soccer fan and had the honor of winning the the 2024 Alabama Intramural Soccer Championship with the [Big Proteins](/assets/big-proteins-fc), quite possibly the greatest soccer team ever assembled in University of Alabama intramurals that year.
