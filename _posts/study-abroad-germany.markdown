#Study Abroad - Germany - Spring 2024
In the spring of my junior year, I had the privilege of studying abroad in LÃ¼neburg, Germany. 
It was a wonderful chance to take a deep dive into German language and culture. 
I learned from German teachers, made German friends, drank German beer.
I was in the wonderful situation of having a German, a Turk, a Bulgarian, and a Russian for roommates. 
For four months, I got to witness the ease of widely available public transportation, green living, no tvs.
