#Capstone Project: Cloud Robotics

For our Capstone Computing Project, my team developed software for the [PuppyPi](https://www.hiwonder.com/products/puppypi?srsltid=AfmBOoob_T0YRTQcpE1lJoqemL3ZmjQ1DwDOW8U412TIGdCUq_nBo4oG),
a simple quadruped robot. We set out to support K12 STEM programs, and we achieved this be making the robot voice interactive,
such that one could speak to the robot in natural language and it would respond in real time.
